# Passwordless Test

This is a simple project done by me, to test how the [passwordless login](https://passwordless.net/getstarted) node module works. 

Hopefully, this attempt turns out more successful than the one i did last week.

Let's see how it goes. Will update on my findings and any others.

## Dependencies

1. Passwordless.
2. EmailJS
3. Express
4. Passwordless-MongoStore

**P.S.:** I am also going to try using the inbuilt Jade Templating Engine feature of Express, just for practice sakes.
